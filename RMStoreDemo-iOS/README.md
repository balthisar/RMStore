# RMStoreDemo-macOS

These materials build all of the iphoneos-derived demo applications, as described
below. The all share the same source code, although Apple TV requires its own
resources, and the targets link to appropriate versions of the RMStoreFramework.

- iPhone/iPad and simulators
- Mac Catalyst
- Apple TV and simulator

Note that in-app-purchases (even in the IAP sandbox) aren't supported by _any_ of the
simulators, and you'll need a real device to try the demos. All of the simulators except
Apple TV simulator can pull the products from the Apple Store, though. You'll need a
real Apple TV to see anything useful with the demo.
